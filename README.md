# Drift Music App
### Drift is a full-stack music database web application built with Next.js that allows users to browse albums, tracks, and lyric quotes in a clean, media-focused interface. The app emphasizes discoverability, structured data relationships, and a smooth, modern user experience.

- Browse albums and tracks stored in a relational PostgreSQL database
- View and create lyric quotes tied to specific songs and timestamps
- Role-based access (guests, users, admins) enforced at the API level
- Responsive UI built with reusable React components

### Drift demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack application that combines thoughtful database design, secure authentication, and polished UI/UX. The project reflects real-world patterns used in production web apps, including role-based access control, REST APIs, and relational data modeling.
